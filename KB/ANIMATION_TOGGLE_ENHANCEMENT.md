# Animation Toggle Enhancement

## Problem
The animation toggle in the diagram editor toolbar was only affecting newly created edges, but existing edges remained static when the animation setting was changed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Animation Toggle Function
Added a new `toggleAllEdgesAnimation` function that updates all existing edges when the animation setting changes:

```typescript
const toggleAllEdgesAnimation = useCallback(
  (enabled: boolean) => {
    setEdges((eds) =>
      eds.map((edge) => ({
        ...edge,
        type: enabled ? 'animatedSvg' : 'smoothstep',
        data: {
          ...edge.data,
          animated: enabled,
        },
      }))
    );
  },
  [setEdges]
);
```

### 2. Combined Handler
Created a `handleAnimationToggle` function that:
- Updates the global animation state
- Immediately applies the animation state to all existing edges

```typescript
const handleAnimationToggle = useCallback(
  (enabled: boolean) => {
    setIsAnimationEnabled(enabled);
    toggleAllEdgesAnimation(enabled);
  },
  [toggleAllEdgesAnimation]
);
```

### 3. Visual Improvements

#### Enhanced Toolbar Button
- Added better visual feedback with icons (üé¨ for on, ‚è∏Ô∏è for off)
- Improved hover states and transitions
- Added descriptive tooltips

#### Smooth Edge Transitions
- Added CSS transitions to edge stroke changes
- Improved animation property handling in AnimatedSVGEdge component

### 4. Consistent Initial State
Updated initial edges to all use the same animation type for consistency:
- All edges now start as `animatedSvg` type
- All have `animated: true` in their data
- Ensures uniform behavior when toggling

## Features

### Real-time Animation Toggle
‚úÖ **Immediate Effect**: All edges respond instantly to animation toggle  
‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Clear button states and transitions  
‚úÖ **Smooth Transitions**: CSS animations for seamless state changes  
‚úÖ **Consistent Behavior**: New and existing edges behave the same way  

### Animation States
- **ON**: All edges use `animatedSvg` type with flowing gradients and dots
- **OFF**: All edges use `smoothstep` type with static styling

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear on/off states in toolbar
- **Instant Feedback**: No need to refresh or recreate edges
- **Visual Consistency**: All edges maintain the same animation state
- **Performance**: Smooth transitions without layout shifts

## Technical Details

### Edge Type Switching
When animation is toggled:
1. **Type Change**: `animatedSvg` ‚Üî `smoothstep`
2. **Data Update**: `animated` property updated in edge data
3. **Visual Update**: AnimatedSVGEdge component responds to data changes

### Animation Components
- **Gradient Animation**: Flowing color effects along the path
- **Dot Animation**: Moving particles following the edge path
- **Transition Effects**: Smooth CSS transitions between states

## Usage
1. Click the "Animations" button in the toolbar
2. All existing edges immediately update their animation state
3. New edges created will follow the current animation setting
4. Visual feedback shows current state (üé¨ On / ‚è∏Ô∏è Off)

This enhancement provides a professional, responsive animation control system that gives users full control over the visual behavior of their diagrams.
